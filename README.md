# Unhandled Database Query Error in Express.js Route

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications:  missing error handling for database queries within API routes. The `bug.js` file shows the flawed code, and `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.

## Description

The `/users/:id` route attempts to fetch user details from a database. However, it lacks proper error handling. If the database query fails (e.g., due to a network issue, database error, or incorrect query), the application might crash or return an unexpected response.

## Problem

The `bug.js` file showcases the issue where a missing `try...catch` block around the database interaction leaves potential errors unhandled.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates how to use `try...catch` to gracefully handle database errors.  The improved version sends an appropriate error response (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error) in case of failure, preventing application crashes and providing informative feedback to the client.

## Setup

(Assuming a database connection is already configured)

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3.  Run `node bug.js` to see the original error behavior.
4.  Run `node bugSolution.js` to see the corrected implementation.
